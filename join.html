		<h2>Joining the project</h2>

		<p>
			The only thing to really know is that you'll need to work with Ruby on Rails, Flutter, and web technologies
			(HTML/CSS/JS/REACT). <br />
			We manage the project and store all the code on GitHub.
		</p>

		<p>
			We're currently working with Dart (Flutter), Ruby (Rails), and HTML/SCSS. We will probably be moving from
			HTML to some JS framework in the future
		</p>

			<h3>Matthew Stead (matievisthekat):</h3>

			<p>
				"I am a keen developer myself and I'm looking for fellow programmers to collaborate with. <br />
				I like to be pretty organised, but don't let that scare you away. I really just want to chill and code with
				people who are as passionate about the project as myself.
			</p>

			<p>"I'm not looking for expert developers and I'm willing to spend some time teaching/explaining things.</p>

			<p>
				"I can't promise any monetary payment, but if the project was to generate profit (one day) and you are still
				a part of the project then you will get an equal share of the profits"
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			If you're fine with all that and you're willing to learn and adapt to the coding style I'm using, then
			please reach out to me personally via:
